*Note to interviewer: Based on responses provided to earlier questions,
the respondent may also be asked Questions 2, 3, and 4 (see interviewer
notes before these questions).*

1\. Have you ever smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?

**1** [ ] Yes

**2** [ ] No

**-8** [ ] DON’T KNOW

**-7** [ ] REFUSED

*If Question 1 is "Yes," then respondent is asked:*

2\. Do you now smoke cigarettes…

**1** [ ] Every day

**2** [ ] Some days

**3** [ ] Not at all

**-8** [ ] DON’T KNOW

**-7** [ ] REFUSED

3\. How many cigarettes have you smoked in your entire life? A pack
usually has 20 cigarettes in it.

**1** [ ] 1 or more puffs but never a whole cigarette

**2** [ ] 1 to 10 cigarettes (about ½ pack total)

**3** [ ] 11 to 20 cigarettes (about ½ pack to 1 pack)

**4** [ ] 21 to 50 cigarettes (more than 1 pack but less than 3 packs)

**5** [ ] 51 to 99 cigarettes (more than 2 ½ packs but less than 5
packs)

**6** [ ] 100 or more cigarettes (5 packs or more)

**-8** [ ] DON’T KNOW

**-7** [ ] REFUSED

*If Question 1 is "Yes" and Question 2 is "Some days" (Current Some-Day
Smoker) or if Question 1 is "Yes" and Question 2 is "Not at all" (Former
Smoker), then respondent is asked:*

4\. Around this time 12 months ago, were you smoking cigarettes every
day, some days, or not at all?

**1** [ ] Every day

**2** [ ] Some days

**3** [ ] Not at all

**-8** [ ] DON’T KNOW

**-7** [ ] REFUSED

*Interpreting responses to assess smoking status of adults:*

-   If answer to Question 1 is "*No,*" then respondent is a "Never
    Smoker."

-   If answer to Question 1 is "*Yes*" and answer to Question 2 is
    "*Every day,*" then respondent is a "Current Every-Day Smoker."

-   If answer to Question 1 is "*Yes*" and answer to Question 2 is
    "*Some days,*" then respondent is a "Current Some-Day Smoker."

-   If answer to Question 1 is "*Yes*" and answer to Question 2 is "*Not
    at all,*" then respondent is a "Former Smoker."

Question 4 allows further classification of Current Some-Day and Former
Smokers into those who smoked every day in the past from those who have
not done so. The former would be indicating heavier past exposure.

The next question is about drinks of alcoholic beverages. By a "drink,"
we mean a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a wine cooler, a
shot of liquor, or a mixed drink with liquor in it. We are not asking

    beverage. How old were you the **first time **you had a drink of an
    alcoholic beverage? Please do not include any time when you only had
    a sip or two from a drink.
