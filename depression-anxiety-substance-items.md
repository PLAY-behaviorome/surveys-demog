## Substance use

### Maternal Inventory of Substance Use (MISU)

Daniel Messinger suggests Maternal Inventory of Substance Use (MISU) or Caregiver Inventory of Substance Use (CISU).
Rick is unable to find the instrument.

### 4P Plus

Rick found the 4P Plus in this reference:

#### Did either of your parents have a problem with alcohol or drugs?

#### Does your partner have a problem with alcohol or drugs?

#### Have you ever drunk beer, wine, or liquor?

#### How much alcohol did you drink in the month before pregnancy? 

#### How many cigarettes did you smoke in the month before pregnancy?

### Use PhenX?

Rick's colleague Steve Wilson said this:

Hi Rick,
You might want to check out measures available in PhenX toolkit. You may already be familiar with it but, if not, the goal of PhenX is to increase standardization across biomedical research. It is one of the resources that NIDA recommends for data harmonization (https://www.drugabuse.gov/researchers/research-resources/data-harmonization-projects). PhenX has instruments for assessing family history of substance use, although I am not sure if they'd be brief enough for your purposes. Information about them is available here: https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.conceptualgroups&id=3397&breadcrumbs=3394,3397. The other resource that might be worth checking out is PROMIS, which is similar to PhenX in terms of facilitating standardization, but I think with more of a focus on patient-oriented research. They have a few substance use measures for adults (http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis/intro-to-promis/list-of-adult-measures).  I think you'd be in good shape selecting a subset from either PhenX or PROMIS. PROMIS may have Spanish translations, not sure about PhenX. Hope that this helps!
Best,
Steve
